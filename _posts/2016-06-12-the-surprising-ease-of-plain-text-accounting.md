title: The Surprising Ease of Plain Text Accounting

As a long time user of [You Need A Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) I was a little dismayed that the [next version](https://www.youneedabudget.com/blog/post/the-new-ynab-is-here) would be a hosted serivce. I had tried similar services before ([Mint](https://www.mint.com/), [Buxfer](https://www.buxfer.com/), [PocketSmith](https://www.pocketsmith.com/), etc) and never found the sacrifice of privacy worth it. All of them felt like they were solving problems I didn't have.

With YNAB 4 now unsupported, I started looking for alternatives. Would I finally surrender to Intuit and start using Quicken? Was a Google Docs spreadsheet enough to get me through? I experimented with [GNU Cash](http://www.gnucash.org/) for a bit and found it very powerful but somewhat difficult to use. A search for other open source tools randomly led me to [Ledger](http://ledger-cli.org/) and my interest was peaked.

Here was a tool that let me store my data in a plain text file and let me control how and where I wanted to store it.
